# Age-Gender-Classification
This project presents a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) tailored for image-based age and gender classification. The architecture consists of convolutional layers with increasing filters (16, 32, 64, 128) and max-pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions, utilizing ReLU activation to extract features from image data. The network is then flattened and passed through fully connected layers with dropout to mitigate overfitting. It has two output branches: one for gender classification using a sigmoid activation and binary cross-entropy loss, and another for age prediction using ReLU activation and mean absolute error (MAE) as the loss function. The Adam optimizer is employed for training, with gender prediction accuracy and MAE for age estimation serving as key performance metrics. This design enhances prediction reliability by learning detailed facial features, tackling challenges like variations in lighting, poses, and data distribution. The model's effectiveness is validated through experimentation on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating its suitability for accurate age and gender prediction.
